# Ruin me image

A silly program that allows you to apply multiple filters to an image to """ruin it""", or enhance it. Depends on your definition of "enhancing".

## Downloading

Check out [the latest release](https://github.com/Raoul1808/ruin-me-image/releases/latest), or download from GitHub actions if you prefer.

NOTE: GitHub actions are all manually run. If you want a "dev build" but you do not have a rust toolchain installed, you can fork this repo, head over to Actions on your fork and manually run the Build Release workflow.

## Building

Pre-requisites:
- A Rust toolchain (preferrably installed using [rustup](https://rustup.rs))

Steps
1. Clone this repo
2. Run `cargo build --release`
3. ???
4. Profit
5. If you want to run directly, run `cargo run --release` instead

AFAIK no extra packages should be needed, but if compilation does not work, please let me know in a GitHub issue.
